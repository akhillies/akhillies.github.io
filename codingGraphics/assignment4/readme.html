COMPILED ON:<br />
 Runs on Mac OSX<br />
<br />
WHERE EVERYTHING IS:<br />
 Main function is in ass4.cpp<br />
 Source code is in src/<br />
 input files of each path are in inputFiles/<br />
 images created by program are in images/<br />
 videos created with the program are in animations/<br />
<br />
FEATURES:<br />
 Has an IK solver that works for any number of ball joints of any length<br />
 can take input from both files and mouse<br />
 Comes with a lot of other extra things just to make the whole thing look that much better (look at IN PROGRAM COMMANDS for more info)<br />
<br />
RESOURCES:<br />
 OpenGL Documentation (and Library)<br />
 Eigen Documentation (and Library)<br />
<br />
COMMAND INPUT:<br />
 ./as4 <FILE NAME> [optional flags]<br />
 optional flags = <br />
 -j n -> add n joints pre-made by me (max of 16) into the system (default takes joints from the input file)<br />
 -e n -> set the error to be n (default is .1)<br />
<br />
INPUT FILE:<br />
 2 commands: &lsquo;v x y z&rsquo; and &rsquo;j l&rsquo;<br />
 if the line starts with &lsquo;v&rsquo;, then it must be followed by 3 floats representing the goal point. The vertices must be placed in order - the arm will follow the points in order<br />
 if the line starts with &lsquo;j&rsquo;, then 1 or 4 floats must follow, representing the length of the joint<br />
<br />
IN PROGRAM COMMANDS:<br />
 Mouse Control = press and hold down the left mouse button on the screen to drag the goal around (it will follow the mouse pointer)<br />
 &lsquo;a&rsquo; = add another joint<br />
 &lsquo;e&rsquo; = erase the paths covered so far (restart the path that is being drawn)<br />
 &lsquo;f&rsquo; = un/freeze the animation<br />
 &lsquo;i&rsquo; = enable/disable user input (must be in form of &lsquo;x y z&rsquo; and can input multiple points at once<br />
 &lsquo;g&rsquo; = draw/don&rsquo;t draw the goal point<br />
 &lsquo;j&rsquo; = draw/don&rsquo;t draw the joints<br />
 &lsquo;l&rsquo; = draw the path that the goal points are taking<br />
 &lsquo;p&rsquo; = draw the path the joints are taking<br />
 &lsquo;r&rsquo; = reset all the world rotations, translating, and scaling<br />
 &rsquo;t&rsquo; = make the joints&rsquo; path a trail instead of path (meaning as the path leaves the joints, they become more and more transparent, eventually becoming invisible)<br />
 Arrow Keys = rotate the selected object (which will be highlighted) or the whole world if no objects selected<br />
 Shift + Arrow Keys = translate selected object or world if none selected<br />
 &lsquo;+/=&lsquo; = scales the selected object to be bigger (or world if no object selected)<br />
 &lsquo;-/_&rsquo; = scales the selected object to be smaller (or world if no object selected)<br />
 SPACE = quit program<br />
