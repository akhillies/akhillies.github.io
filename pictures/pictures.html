                        <p>This page contains some of the images I have created over the years ("years" meaning about 3 since I don't have anything from before that). They were all either drawn with Adobe Illustrator or edited with Adobe Photoshop. Obviously, each image had a different process before being deemed presentable, but all had a similar list of events (though the order did vary sometimes).<p>
                        <p>I first got into the whole drawing thing when I was bored in class when waiting for the professor or GSI to start and I did not want to pull out my phone (or I did not have it, aka pre-11th grade). I would just doodle random things, mainly dragon heads and serpent bodies sometimes with arms, legs, and even wings. The whole fantasy thing was where my mind always drifted because it was where the impossible was - everything in reality almost always appeared better when shown in real life so there would be no point in expressing it in another way (unless of course there was some non-realistic factor, though honestly, with modern 3D graphics and CGI, everything may look better when shown in live-action and I may have to rethink my previous statement...).</p>

                    Influenced by an Italian friend who actually has an official family crest, I decided to design on that I think would be cool for me to have attached to my own name :D. It is still a work-in-progress, but here is the process I have gone through so far to create it.

                    The cross blades are from the video game Kingdom Hearts by Square Enix, I just had really liked the idea of crossed blades and used them as placeholders but now I feel like they do not fit the rest of the theme I have going.
