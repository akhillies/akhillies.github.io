                            <p>This page contains some of the images I have created over the years ("years" meaning about 3 since I don't have anything from before that). They were all either drawn with Adobe Illustrator or edited with Adobe Photoshop. Obviously, each image had a different process before being deemed presentable, but all had a similar list of events (though the order did vary sometimes).<p>
                            <p>I first got into the whole drawing thing when I was bored in class when waiting for the professor or GSI to start and I did not want to pull out my phone (or I did not have it, aka pre-11th grade). I would just doodle random things, mainly dragon heads and serpent bodies sometimes with arms, legs, and even wings. The whole fantasy thing was where my mind always drifted because it was where the impossible was - everything in reality almost always appeared better when shown in real life so there would be no point in expressing it in another way (unless of course there was some non-realistic factor, though honestly, with modern 3D graphics and CGI, everything may look better when shown in live-action and I may have to rethink my previous statement...).</p>

I love it, which is all that matters to me, and I will probably end up using it everywhere I can for the rest of my life as my mark.</p>
                                <p class="lead">Now that I got that out of my system, let me go a little into how it came about: stuff I love. The first thing is I love mythological creatures, and above all, dragons. So here is the first one:<br/><br/><img src="media/logo/brandish2.png" alt="Image not loaded" align="left"/>First of all, yes, of course, I had to add my name to it &#9786. The dragons here act as posts, giving a sort of guardian look with my name in the center. My imagination is always going all over the place, something needs to hold it down right? It does not end here, the colors are actually pulled from my school colors (hey I have some school pride!) and just because I really enjoyed playing with that combination of colors. I applied my study in colors and color interaction to make the yellow and blue (which are complementary colors) look good together. Then from here, I worked on moving towards the next thing I knew I wanted to include - cross blades.<br/><br/><img src="media/logo/logo.png" alt="Image didn't load" align="right"/><br/>Now this part was done a lot on my own, with the main inspiration coming from different swords. The handle is a saber handle - taking inspiration from the large hand guard that goes around the knuckles as well. There is a hook around the opposite end of the handle to allow space for the thumb to grip.<br/>The blade is both simple and complicated if that makes any sense... Simple in the sense that the important part was for the handle and the blade to be in perfect sync with each other, so the handle had to be shaped like a blade but have the designs of a handle grip (hence why it is simple and complicated). Everything else was added as fluff to make it look epic and unique . You can look to the left to see the result, but remember, I don't care if you judge :P.</p>
