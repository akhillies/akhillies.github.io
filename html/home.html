                            <p class="lead">I am a third year Computer Science major at UC Berkeley. I was born and raised in Silicon Valley before going off to college. I have been programming since 9th grade in high school when I took my first Java course and since then I have never stopped. I am most interested in computer graphics - mainly in the Front-End involving UI/UX (user interface/experience) and animation. I love playing with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to make/edit pictures and I have also gotten into AutoDesk's Maya for 3D animation.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">Outside of school, I love playing soccer, swimming, and most of all, martial arts. I am currently a 3rd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do (the Korean martial art) and I am a part of UC Berkeley's Tae Kwon Do competition team. I also love teaching people, always willing to help no matter what I have going on. I have done tutoring in both Math and Science as well as taught Tae Kwon Do in my hometown's studio and at Berkeley.
