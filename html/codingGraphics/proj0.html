                        <p class="lead">So this was my first project using OpenGL. The goal of this project was to create a simple OpenGL program that utilized very simple aspects of the library. Orirginally, the plan was just to make some static image that was generated using polygons but after starting the project, I decided to use some sort of animation as well as some user interaction. I also took this chance to get back into web programming and create this website. It was a great first project and if you would like to learn more about this project and how I completed it, just <a href="mailto:akhilbatra@berkeley.edu">email</a> me.</p>

                        <p class="lead comments">This project marked the first time I ever programmed in C++. I had done coding in Java before, using the Swing library to create graphics, but this was the first time coding outside of Java Swing. It was quite the experience and really made me realize the ups and downs of different languages (mainly between Java and C++ in terms of user-friendly vs coder-friendly, speed vs readability, and so on). While this project was not too much of a challenge overall, it was the first stepping stone I took in making a dynamic program with OpenGL. I managed to have both user input and randomness (each time the code is run, the resulting animation is different), which went beyond my original intentions. Next time I work with this library, I plan on exploring more of the 3D effects from shading and lighting.</p>
