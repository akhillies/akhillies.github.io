COMPILED ON:<br />
 Runs on Mac OSX<br />
<br />
WHERE EVERYTHING IS:<br />
 Main function is in ass2.cpp<br />
 Source code is in src/<br />
 obj files are in objFiles/<br />
 final image outputs are in output/images/<br />
<br />
<br />
RESOURCES:<br />
 got FreeImage from http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/<br />
 updated the OSX MakeFile from https://github.com/sol-prog/FreeImage-OSX<br />
<br />
<br />
INPUT:<br />
 Takes in obj files with a couple catches (look at rules):<br />
<br />
w x = sets the width of the image to be rendered<br />
h y = sets the height of the image to be rendered<br />
<br />
eye x y z = specifies the camera position for the screen<br />
ll x y z = specifies the lower left point of image plane<br />
lr x y z = specifies the lower right point of image plane<br />
ul x y z = specifies the upper left point of image plane<br />
ur x y z = specifies the upper right point of image plane<br />
d n = specifies the depth for the rays - will be same for all rays in this image<br />
<br />
v x y z = vertex at (x, y, z) -> assigned numbers 1, 2,&#8230; based on input order<br />
<br />
f v1 v2 v3 = triangular face with vertices at index v1, v2, v3 -> counter-clockwise order and also numbered from 1 onwards based on when inputted (these indices are continued with spheres)<br />
s x y z r = sphere with center at (x, y, z) and radius r -> indices numbered from 1 onwards (indices for spheres are continued from the indices for faces)<br />
<br />
kd n r g b = diffuse color for the n-th object -> RGB values must be between 0 and 1<br />
ks n r g b i = specular color and intensity for the n-th object -> rgb values must be between 0 and 1<br />
ka n r g b = ambient color of the n-th object<br />
kr n r g b = reflectance percentage of each rgb value<br />
<br />
pl x y z r g b = point light -> xyz and rgb of the light<br />
dl x y z r g b = directional light -> xyz and rgb of the light<br />
<br />
sca n x y z = scales the n-th object by the give x y z along the respective axises<br />
rot n x y z = specifies the DEGREES the n-th object needs to be rotated in each xyz direction
