WHERE EVERYTHING IS:<br />
 Main function is in ass3.cpp<br />
 Source code is in src/<br />
 input files of individual objects are in inputFiles/<br />
 scene files are in scenes/<br />
 output files are in output/<br />
 images created by program are in images/<br />
<br />
FEATURES:<br />
 Can read .bez and .obj files<br />
 Has hidden line mode<br />
 Can read in multiple files (each one holding one object) and give each a unique transformation<br />
 Has basic phong shading<br />
 Can activate wire frame as well as fill mode at same time<br />
 Can output OBJ files and then read in those files (as well as others)<br />

IN PROGRAM COMMANDS:<br />
 f = activates wire frame while keeping the filled frame<br />
 h = activates hidden line mode<br />
 s = switches between smooth and flat shading<br />
 w = activates wire frame mode<br />
 Arrow Keys = rotate the selected object (which will be highlighted) or the whole world if no objects selected<br />
 Shift + Arrow Keys = translate selected object or world if none selected<br />
 SPACE = quit program<br />
 +/= = scales the selected object to be bigger (or world if no object selected)<br />
 - = scales the selected object to be smaller (or world if no object selected)<br />
<br />
INPUT REQUIREMENTS:<br />
 Make sure to only have 1 object PER FILE - input can take either .bez or .obj without any extra input command, even in the combined file<br />
 Basic command line always starts with &ldquo;./as3 <INPUT_FILE>&rdquo;, then follow the instructions below for each type of input file and what must be in the file<br />
 FOR .SCENE FILES:<br />
 For command line input, there cannot be anything else after the <INPUT_FILE><br />
 Inside the file, each line has to be defining its own object<br />
 All lines will start with the file name (files must be placed in &ldquo;inputFiles/&ldquo;)<br />
 Next will be the subdivision parameter (not used if .obj file)<br />
 And finally the optional -a tag if the user wishes to have adaptive tessellation rather than uniform (only used for .bez files)<br />
 FOR .BEZ FILES:<br />
 Command line input must have the subdivision parameter after the <FILE_NAME> followed by an optional -a tag for adaptive tessellation versus the default uniform<br />
 First line must have the number of patches in the objects as first set of characters<br />
 From second line onwards, each line defines a Bezier curve, and every 4 lines defines a Bezier surface<br />
 Curves are defined by 4 sets of vectors (with 3 values each) and must be written on the same line in order and with at least one space in between each float<br />
 In between each Bezier surface, there must be a blank line<br />
 FOR .OBJ FILES:<br />
 Command line input must have the <FILE_NAME> followed by nothing else<br />
 Commands within the file available:<br />
 v x y z = for defining a vertex at point x, y, z<br />
 vn x y z = for defining vertex normals with vector as x, y, z (does not have to be normalized). This normal will be assigned to the first vertex created that has no normal (vertex must be created before assigning normal)<br />
 f v1 v2 v3 <v4> = for defining a face with the given vertices (can only take 3 vertices). v1, v2, and v3 correspond to the index of the vertex, it goes in order of vertices inputted starting from 1 (vertices must be created before assigning to a face) and the vertex indices must be written in clockwise order, and there can be 3 to 4 vertices per face<br />
 ka r g b = ambient color of all the faces in this file, values must be between 0 and 1<br />
 kd r g b = diffuse color for all the faces in this file, RGB values must be between 0 and 1<br />
 ks r g b i = specular color and intensity for all the faces in this file, RGB values must be between 0 and 1
